# Using Python IDLE

Python IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment) is a simple yet effective IDE that comes bundled with Python. It's particularly useful for beginners to write, run, and debug Python code.

## 1. Launching IDLE

### On Windows:
Search for "IDLE" in the Windows search bar and click on the "IDLE (Python X.Y 64-bit)" application.

### On macOS:
1. Open Finder.
2. Go to `Applications` -> `Python X.Y` (where X.Y is your Python version).
3. Double-click on "IDLE".

### On Linux:
Open a terminal and type `idle3` (or `idle-python3.x` if you installed it that way) and press Enter.

## 2. The Python Shell (Interactive Window)

When you launch IDLE, the first window you'll see is the Python Shell. This is an interactive interpreter where you can type Python commands and see the results immediately.

-   **Prompt:** You'll see a prompt `>>>`. This indicates that the interpreter is ready to accept commands.
-   **Executing Code:** Type a Python expression or statement and press Enter. The interpreter will execute it and display the output (if any).

### Example:
```python
>>> print("Hello, IDLE!")
Hello, IDLE!
>>> 2 + 3
5
>>> name = "Alice"
>>> print(f"My name is {name}")
My name is Alice
```

The shell is great for testing small snippets of code, experimenting with syntax, and debugging.

## 3. Creating and Running Python Files (.py)

For writing longer programs, you'll want to create a new file.

### Steps:

1.  **Open a New File:** In the IDLE Shell window, go to `File` -> `New File` (or press `Ctrl+N` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+N` on macOS). This will open a new, empty editor window.
2.  **Write Your Code:** Type your Python code into this new editor window.

    ### Example:
        # my_script.py
        def greet(name):
            return f"Hello, {name} from a Python file!"

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
            message = greet(user_name)
            print(message)
```

3.  **Save the File:** Go to `File` -> `Save` (or `Ctrl+S`/`Cmd+S`). Choose a location and give your file a meaningful name with a `.py` extension (e.g., `my_script.py`).
4.  **Run the File:** With the code editor window active, go to `Run` -> `Run Module` (or press `F5`).

    *   The script will execute in the Python Shell window.
    *   If your script has `input()` calls, you'll type your input directly into the Shell window.
    *   The output of your script will also appear in the Shell window.

### Example of Running `my_script.py`:
```
>>> = RESTART: C:/Users/YourUser/Documents/my_script.py
Enter your name: Bob
Hello, Bob from a Python file!
>>>
