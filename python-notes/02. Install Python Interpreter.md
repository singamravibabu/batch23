# Install Python Interpreter

This document outlines the steps to install the Python interpreter, specifically focusing on setting up Python IDLE and Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with the Python extension.

## 1. Install Python Interpreter (with IDLE)

IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment) is Python's default integrated development environment. It's a simple IDE that comes bundled with the Python installation.

### Steps for Windows:

1.  **Download Python:** Go to the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2.  **Choose the latest stable version:** Download the appropriate installer for your Windows system (e.g., "Windows installer (64-bit)").
3.  **Run the installer:**
    *   **Crucially, check the box that says "Add Python X.Y to PATH"** (where X.Y is your Python version) at the bottom of the installer window. This will allow you to run Python from the command line.
    *   Click "Install Now" for a typical installation or "Customize installation" if you want to choose specific features or installation location. For most users, "Install Now" is sufficient.
4.  **Complete the installation:** Follow the on-screen prompts. Once finished, you should see a "Setup was successful" message.
5.  **Verify Installation:**
    *   Open the Command Prompt (search for `cmd`).
    *   Type `python --version` and press Enter. You should see the installed Python version.
    *   Type `pip --version` and press Enter. You should see the pip version (Python's package installer).
    *   To open IDLE, search for "IDLE" in your Windows search bar and launch it.

### Steps for macOS:

1.  **Download Python:** Go to the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2.  **Choose the latest stable version:** Download the appropriate installer for your macOS system (e.g., "macOS 64-bit universal2 installer").
3.  **Run the installer:** Open the downloaded `.pkg` file and follow the installation wizard. Python usually installs in `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/X.Y`.
4    sudo apt update
    ```
2.  **Install Python 3 and pip (if not already installed):**
    ```bash
    sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
    ```
3.  **Verify Installation:**
    *   Open the Terminal.
    *   Type `python3 --version` and press Enter.
    *   Type `pip3 --version` and press Enter.
    *   IDLE might not be installed by default. To install it:
        ```bash
        sudo apt install idle-python3.x  # Replace x with your Python minor version, e.g., idle-python3.10
