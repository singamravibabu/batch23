# Using VS Code for Python Coding

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular, lightweight, yet powerful source code editor developed by Microsoft. It offers excellent support for Python development through its extensive marketplace of extensions. This guide will walk you through setting up VS Code for Python coding.

## 1. Install VS Code

If you don't already have VS Code installed, follow these steps:

1.  **Download VS Code:** Go to the official VS Code website: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2.  **Choose your operating system:** Download the installer for Windows, macOS, or Linux.
3.  **Run the installer:** Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

## 2. Install the Python Extension

The Python extension for VS Code provides rich support for Python development, including IntelliSense (code completion), linting, debugging, code formatting, and more.

1.  **Open VS Code.**
2.  **Go to the Extensions view:** Click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code (it looks like four squares, one of which is detached) or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+X` (macOS).
3.  **Search for "Python":** In the search bar, type "Python".
4.  **Install the Microsoft Python extension:** Look for the extension published by Microsoft (usually the first result) and click the "Install" button.

## 3. Configure Python Interpreter

VS Code needs to know which Python interpreter to use for your projects.

1.  **Open a Python file or a folder containing Python files.** (You can create a new file: `File` -> `New File`, save it as `test.py`).
2.  **Select the Python Interpreter:**
    *   Click on the Python version displayed in the Status Bar at the bottom left of the VS Code window (e.g., `Python 3.9.7 64-bit`).
    *   Alternatively, open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`), type `Python: Select Interpreter`, and press Enter.
3.  **Choose your interpreter:** VS Code will list all detected Python installations. Select the one you want to use for your project. If you    # hello.py
    def greet(name):
        return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to VS Code Python development."

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
        message = greet(user_name)
        print(message)
    
import unittest

class TestGreet(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_greet_with_name(self):
        self.assertEqual(greet("Alice"), "Hello, Alice! Welcome to VS Code Python development.")
    
    def test_greet_with_empty_name(self):
        self.assertEqual(greet(""), "Hello, ! Welcome to VS Code Python development.")

    def test_greet_with_special_characters(self):
        self.assertEqual(greet("P@ul"), "Hello, P@ul! Welcome to VS Code Python development.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main(argv=['first-arg-is-ignored'], exit=False)
